# Project Title

This is a simple program that demonstrates the difference between Array and ArrayList.

## Arrays vs ArrayList

**Arrays**
- Have a fixed size and cannot be changed
- Holds elements of a specific type
- Accessng elements via index
- Can be modified usng their index
- Can be iterated with loops
- No dynamic resizing; to change the size of an array, you'd have to make a new array and copy the elements over

**ArrayLists**
- Dynamic resizing when elements are added or removed
- Methods can be used for convenience (add(), remove(), get(), etc.)
- Can also use iteration with loops
